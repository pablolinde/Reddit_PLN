As of now, the only person we absolutely know was on the ~~plane~~ Helicopter was Kobe so it's better to wait for some confirmation on the other people on the plane.\n\nEdit #2:  12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.\n\nEdit #3: Multiple sources are saying that Rick Fox is safe and well the information spread about him being in the helicopter is not true.\n\nEdit #4: There were 9 people on the plane including Kobe and his daughter Gianna. Three of them have been identified as Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife and his daughter",

The very same behavior he has criticized so many for when it was an issue that mattered to him.\n\nNobody needs a politician here LeBron, they need you as a role model to just say what you believe whether its the perfect thing to say or not, because THAT is what is important.\n\nNobody learns anything from hiding. You say what you believe in, and ask honest questions about what you dont know about, and everyone has a chance to grow and learn.\n\nHiding to try and protect your brand is the EXACT thing that will devalue it and make you look like a cheap phony. It weakens your stance on *everything*, even the things you do know a lot about and want to champion. It's just a weak move to not say what you think. Accept the possibility that you can be wrong or ill-prepared or less informed, because that is the only way you can grow. Nobody says the right thing every time, but I can guarantee you that trying to say nothing is almost always the wrong move. You rob others of a chance to hear a powerful opinion, or on the other hand rob yourself of a chance to learn and be humbled.\n\nSome things are bigger than basketball, and even bigger than a single important event. Some things set a precedent for how a platform is used for *all* events going forward. Dont set the example that you hide from things and only support causes for things that you can see yourself in, because that is not how any type of unity spreads. Expand your horizons, and stand up for your values. Especially when it is difficult and you aren't so positively sure that you're right. That is when it is most important to discuss things.",

        "description": "Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won’t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up. Just wanted to take the opportunity to say how much I appreciate r/NBA for being the best fucking sub on this site (**d**espite y'all nephews calling my boy *hitler*), than**k**s to all my fellow redditors for t**h**e nice words and the ridiculous amount of gold.",

Taking the “no publicity is bad publicity” route and it’s annoying.",

                "comment": "May 23, 2010. The Suns had just won game 3 of the WCF against LA, 118-109. Kobe had 36, but went 2-8 from beyond the arc, missing his only two attempts in the 4th when the game was close. Game ended at 11 pm, and I had a few things to finish up before heading home. The way the arena was set up, the fastest route to the parking garage was to walk through the main bowl after leaving the office. As I make my way out at 11:30 pm, the lights in the arena dim, I hear a ball bouncing on the main court. I look to see who it was, and found Kobe out there shooting 3s. By himself. Top of the key, shoot, make it, get the ball. Back to the top of the key, shoot, miss, get the rebound. No coaches, no trainers, no teammates. Just the best player on earth, practicing his 3 point shot, alone. I sat down about 20 rows up, in an otherwise empty 18,000 seat arena, and watched one of the best five humans to ever play the sport practice in solitude for 25 minutes. After he had put up probably 75 or 80 threes from all around the arc, he grabbed the ball and went to the locker rooms. \n\nThat night taught me so much about what it meant to be THE. BEST. About putting in work that no one sees. About perseverance. About never being happy with how good you are and always wanting to improve, even if you’re already the best. Kobe made a lifelong fan in those 25 minutes. RIP to one of the all time greats.",

I was a kid with cancer during the '01 playoff run. I had a make a wish foundation wish to let you know how bad I was. I wanted to meet Shaq and Kobe. It's late May early June so yeah that's not happening so I settle for a PS2 a bunch of tech stuff and a big screen tv (I couldn't travel because my immune system was shot and I was afraid to ask for too big of a TV to tell you how innocent I was).   \n\n\nWell....two weeks later I get a call. Who but Bean, calling me telling me he heard I wanted to meet him and how he was out there playing for kids like me and how he appreciated having me as a fan and to hang in there and I can overcome anything ect.   \n\n\nIt was only a 4-5 minute call but it lifted my spirits. I never told any of my friends about it, only my parents eve knew about it. I'm not saying it saved my life, but it gave me hope....  \n\n\nI had a \\~20% chance for survival.   \n\n\nThat was 20 years ago.  \n\n\nThat man influenced the way I look at and attack life. \n\n I woke up this evening to the news of his passing and I've been crying on and off the entire time here at work trying to reason with myself \"hey this is just a basketball player why the fuck are you crying man get over it\" But I felt like a member of my own family passed.

He has just finished a rigorous practice. He sits just off the court, uncharacteristically still, gazing past the rookies shooting free throws. He’s thought a lot about that September morning, a lot about the nature of disaster in general. “Things change in the blink of an eye,” he says. “It’s really scary. That’s the toughest part of life to me: People go to work and don’t come back. One minute they’re living; the next minute they’re not. And it doesn’t matter who you are. There’s nothing you can do about it. Bill Cosby’s son was killed. Something that still upsets me in the death of Michael Jordan’s father.”\n\nhttp://www.thestacksreader.com/what-kobe-bryant-was-capable-of/",

No proof of election fraud, no oppression or being denied rights. They waltzed in, trashed and looted the Capitol Building and threatened the lives of Senators, Congress Members, the Vice President, other staff and was met with little force. They went with their confederate flags trying to violently destroy the American Democratic Process. \n\nThere is absolutely no comparison with BLM. Shit, most of those terrorists couldn't even handle Kaepernick kneeling silently. But here we are 2021, still too hesitant to call out right wing domestic terrorists.",

        "description": "MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. \n\nI would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.  I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.  I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.  In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. \n\nI decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.  At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.  This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.  This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.  This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.  A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.  This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. \n\nJust 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.  8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.  I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.  By my count he actually had 3 fewer \"stocks\"(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.  I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.  \n\nJaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.  Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. \n\nI conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.  He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.  He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.  He had 129 \"stocks\" in Memphis vs. 121 \"stocks\" on the road.  BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home/away record difference to crowd noise to effort/energy/intensity exerted by players, etc.\n90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.  My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. \n\nWhy is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... \n\nThree potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: \n\n1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home/away splits. \n\n2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.  When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. \n\n3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. \n\nI and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.  It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.  This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. \n\nI decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.  Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.  Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.  Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.  When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.  When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. \n\nThe following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: \n\nExample #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSaturday 12/31\n7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter\nZion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. \"Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans\" announcers say.  Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup \n\nExample #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSunday 1/8 \n10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter\nJordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.  Bane actually steals the ball. \n\nExample #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies\nSunday 1/8\n1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter\nKelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.  The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.  Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals \n\nExample #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies\nMonday 1/16\n7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter\nBrandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. \n\nExample #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday 1/18\n11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter\nLamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.  The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. \n\nExample #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies\nFriday, December 9th\n39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter\nJackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. \n\nExample #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday, December 7th\n10:38 4th quarter\nJackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. \n\nThank you very much for reading this.  I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.  Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks/months later?",

        "description": "##Effective immediately, r/nba will be banning links to Twitter/X, as well as other social media platforms that require logins for their content to be browsed, including Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nWe have reached this decision after taking recent events and strong sentiment from our community into account. While we try our best to stay neutral and apolitical, we do not believe taking a stance against Nazi symbolism is or should be a political issue. Hate speech and the promotion of it has never been tolerated in our community.\n\nIn addition, our users have brought forth issues regarding Twitter and other social platforms like it, ranging from accessibility, to content quality, to concerns over data privacy. Since the change in ownership, Twitter has also seen a significant rise in spam and x-rated content.\n\nBelow, we will provide further context for how we came to this decision and how we will operate going forward. Additionally, we will be monitoring the situation for the next 30 days to gauge user experience and feedback on the impact to the subreddit and solicit further feedback, and implement any changes at that time. \n\nPlease feel free to provide any feedback or opinions on the matter. \n\nThank you\n\n___\n\n**Why do this now?**\n\nIn the end, there were three key elements in making this decision:\n\n* An increase in hate speech and discriminatory language, both on Twitter overall and coming directly from the owner of the platform. \n* A litany of functionality, usability and content quality issues that have existed for a while. \n* Considering the sentiment of our users.\n\nWe tried to consider any and all factors and felt this was the clearest path forward at this juncture.\n\n**Why not permit screenshots of Tweets?**\n\nThis was something we went back and forth on but decided it was not a can of worms we wanted to open right now but would monitor as an option down the road. While screenshots are an easy alternative to posting direct links, there are a few reasons why we want to go without screenshots first:\n\n* The biggest concern with screenshots is that they are much more difficult to verify as legitimate.\n* Screenshots are not accessibility-friendly for screen readers.\n* If we are banning Twitter and other major platforms, we do not want to take half measures.\n* Reddit and r/nba are a significant factor in the internet content ecosystem. We believe that if reddit traffic is not supporting platforms like Twitter in any way, that journalists and content creators in the space will be encouraged to move to alternative platforms that don't compromise their users and offer better accessibility for content.\n\n**Is this censorship of content?**\n\nEnsuring that we were not limiting or censoring content was one of the primary points of discussion for us. We do not believe that this handicaps or censors content because we are not putting a restriction on specific content or subject matter. We believe that any notable story that takes place in the NBA environment will still find its way to our subreddit through other avenues that are still permitted. \n\n**So where do we go from here?**\n\nWhile we are not endorsing any specific platform, the platform we have seen suggested most from our users and one where we believe a significant contingent of NBA reporters have already made their way over to is BlueSky. ESPN reporters are also beginning to use notifications from the ESPN app. \n\nThank you again and please feel free to provide feedback on these new rules!",

                "comment": "I lost my best friend this past November and was so incredibly heartbroken, hurt and confused that I spent nearly all my time for the next 2 weeks crying and trying to search for answers. I eventually came across the following passage/metaphor on reddit. Hopefully this can help some of those who are hurting. I saved the text but not the post, so if anyone can find the original or the author please share as it is a beautiful piece. \n\n~~~~\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",

I was at several. \n\nToday showed we have a real problem - thousands of people stormed our capitol genuinely believing the election was rigged.

Do you not remember Chaz 1& 2? Do you not remember federal buildings being stormed over and over again? Do you not remember cities going up in flames? Do you not remember 30 deaths and over $2 billion in damages?\n\nThe same media and social media which is currently going absolutely mental over these idiotic Qanon riots was essentially running cover for the Antifa/BLM riots by downplaying the gravity of the violence with their \"mostly peaceful protests\" narrative, for months on end. Reddit was more than happy to cheer for the unlawful violence then. The corporate media and social media refused to call Antifa terrorists, a violent group of traitors which literally wants to destroy America, for doing the same riotous shit that these Qanon morons are doing today, yet watch how freely these same groups are throwing around the \"terrorist\" label today.\n\nThe same politicians getting all sanctimonious over these Qanon fools were turning a blind eye to or even encouraging Antifa/BLM rioting fools just a few months ago. Even going as far as funding their fucking bailout money.\n\nThe absolute worst thing about NBA activism is the fact that the NBA and it's players have willingly made themselves China's bitch. The league and it's star players rake in billions from the most evil political regime on earth today, while they moralize us at home. Fuck. Off.\n\nThe hypocrisy is gross, and the sheer amount of people who willingly, even eagerly, participate in these collective delusions is truly frightening.\n\nGet a grip America.",
