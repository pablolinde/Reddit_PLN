This far-right white supremacist and anti-immigration Trump sycophant was [ready to double down](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-reveals-aggressive-second-term-immigration-agenda-n1245407) on his position in a second term. A lot of the beauty in our country comes from our diversity in both the landscapes and the people.",

It wasn’t just Trump’s insanity, or Mitch and the 2000 checks, or the insanity of the GOP... it was the casual conservative member allowing themselves to be seduced by false prophets.

They have two years to offer an extremely stark contrast against Trump's presidency. If they get a lot of meaningful change done, the vacuum left in Trump's absence might actually persuade some of his supporters to realize \"oh wow, I really was conned, my life really *is* significantly better under Democratic leadership.\" I can only think that's the case because Trump had a ton of support from non-voters who aren't necessarily Republicans. So they won't default to automatically voting for Republican in 2022 or 2024.\n\nThe things that the Democrats offer have to really be meaningful for the working class, though. If poor Mississippians finally feel like their lives are improving, they can be won over. If the focus is only on things that appeal mainly to big-city voters, the Republicans will win big again. It's not that I don't support things like trans protections, for example, and I think meaningful positive change is needed there, but I hope that at some point, there's a realization that so many of Trump's voters weren't conservative or Republican, they were desperate and struggling lower-class workers who have felt abandoned. Some of them have never met a trans person in their life. That's not to dismiss the fight for trans rights by any means, but those Trump voters *can* be won over, despite what it may seem, by having someone fight for their economic interests and give them a leg up. Now is the time to just fucking go for it and try to win back some of the voters that Trump really let down.",

Imagine the alternative, if the House did not assert itself and simply allowed the Executive to do what it wants without repercussion. It would set a terrible precedent which would set another precedent until we completely do away with our American experiment.\n\nEvents like this, **even if only symbolic, are important**.

These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. \n\nAt that time I wasn’t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:\n\nhttps://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\n\nFolks, if you’re not sure if you are registered, or even if you are sure, just take the 30 seconds to confirm if you are registered to vote. And if you aren’t, well here ya go:\n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote\n\n**Edit 2** Also adding the link to fair fight. \n\nThis is the initiative Stacey Abrahms has initiated to protect voter registration rights, to stop funny business from unscrupulous voting suppression shenanigans the GOP has been deploying - thanks fellow Redditer for he suggestion. \n\n\nhttps://fairfight.com/\n\n**Edit 3**  **(my favorite edit ever)**\n\n*A fellow Redditer sent me a message just now, informing me they registered to vote, from the link I attached above.

Trump voters/conservatives would lose further faith in the US government and systems, further radicalize them, and would find sympathy with Trump and view Putin more positively. \n\nTrump being the easily manipulated useful idiot that he is, would 100% go along with this. Plus he wants to avoid financial ruin and prison. So he really has no choice. \n\nThe icing on the cake will be the hard intelligence/national security secrets Trump would hand over. Despite him not really paying attention to intelligence reports or briefings, he still would certainly possess some level of classified/sensitive information about various things (US military readiness, national security, intelligence apparatus to some degree). You don't get a better asset than a former US President. \n\nPutin/Russia would absolutely love to have this information, and Trump would happily exchange it over for assurances of his freedom, resources, money, etc. Hell, Trump may even direct some of his staff (who flee with him) to gather more stuff to hand over. Odds are Putin is whispering this stuff into his ears right now, priming him to do so. The precedent has already been set as well.

The original was deleted but you can find various versions of the original flooding around at this time last year.\n\n***\n\nI really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect during his last months in office. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.\n\nImagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months its the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the country. Insisting he's still the President and he never really lost the election. \n\nBut then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.\n\nNo one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no ones cares.\n\nHe's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.\n\nHis days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.\n\nHis children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.\nFree from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose \"Stockholm Syndrome\" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.\n\nThey are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.\nMelania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again\nTrump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.\n\nHe very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.\n\nBut within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.\n\nEventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.\n\nThe official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.\nThe Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.\nIn death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Some infinite presidents are recognized for the disasters they got us into like the Iraq war and the Vietnam war, but Trump managed to kill far more Americans than that by simple incompetence. A quarter of a million people died as a result of his ego, and then close to that many died the following year while the country worked to sort out the mess he left behind and get the virus under control.\n\nIn US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page in the section on politics. In fact he has mentioned far more in the discussion of disasters that hit the United States than on any sort of political achievements - because he didn’t actually achieve anything, he simply failed to act based on his own arrogance. And that’s all he’s remembered for. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as \"tacky\".\n\nNow he is simply: \"What was the name of the President attributed to the largest preventable disaster in American history?”\n\nThe answer is \"(C) Donald J. Trump\"",

Kushner was there but there is no reaction from him. \n\nThen they completed what looked like a decent start of a plan and they handed it off to Jared to be taken to the President late in March with the expectation of the group members that it would be announced the following week. And it died for no known reason.\n\nSo the underlying article does not say Jared killed the plan to kill Democrats, but it certainly appears that the President might have when it got to him, or at minimum, he was doing what we all knew he was doing at the time. Denying the problem so the stock market would do well. \n\nIt was a long article and maybe I missed something, but that is how I read it.\n\nEdit. Some typos.",

It is achieved by predominantly playing to the uneducated and shallow thinking masses, and keeping them from being educated in critical thinking.\n\nUmberto Eco speaks of ur-fascism (a generic right wing dictatorship complimentary to but different than fascism). He also has fourteen characteristics of fascism in his essay Ur-Fascism and also stated **\"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it\".**\n\nhttps://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf\n\n2 problems with the DHS response in Portland:\n\n1. Anticipatory arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n2. Non-custodial arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nViolations of the 4^th and 14^th amendments.\n\nJames Waterman Wise Jr. said, in February of 1936, when fascism comes to the US \"it will probably be “wrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution.”\n\n3 of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here(Lawrence Britt Spring 2003 based upon the article \"The Hallmarks of Fascist Regime\" by Skip Stone):\n\n* **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n * **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  \n\n* **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**\n\n**Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.**There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\nhttps://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/two-dhs-officials-apparently-just-admitted-their-troops-have-been-violating-the-constitution/\n\n1 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Fraudulent Elections**\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. **Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.**\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/11th-circuit-florida-fines-fees-judicial-ethics.html\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Religion and Government are Intertwined**\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n* **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Corporate Power is Protected**\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n* **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n\n* Fascist Review:\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-25/portland-finally-proves-it-trump-is-pulling-us-into-fascism\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-is-donald-trump-a-fascist-1.8913249\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-fascist-performance\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-fascism-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-a9546941.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng",

In my 30 years the only time I've seen a klansman come out of the woods was on Jerry Springer and Im pretty sure he was just an actor. I certainly believe the Klan deserves to be labeled a \"hate group\" by the ADL but until the start burning crosses in people's front yards again I don't think the label terrorist applies. What they do now out in the woods now is not much different from some weird occult cult activity, its not like their sacrificing black babies out there or anything and I'm pretty sure the feds have agents implanted in their ranks so we would know about it if they did. \n\nMy fear is that pushing these people even further when we've already driven them out of society with social pressure will only lead to them taking violent actions once again. They already believe they are losing \"their country\" to POC and the Jews. If we start prosecuting them as terrorists without due cause that will only strengthen their beliefs that they are being persecuting and will only radicalize them further. If they are content with going out in the woods, burning a few crosses, chanting, then getting drunk and having a bbq then frankly I'm happy where they're at. \n\nI'm actually a big fan of Daryl Davis, the black musician who goes to these klan rallies and befriends the members. I believe the only way to get people to stop believing in the klan is to show them they are wrong, not using the force of the law. You can't legislate people's beliefs, but you can show them they are wrong.",

Had we treated 911 as a crime rather than a terrorist act, we wouldn't have entered into decades of war in the middle east under false pretenses. And we wouldn't have allowed innocent people to be imprisoned in Guantanamo for decades. We wouldn't be engaging in extra-judicial killings around the world, using drones.\n\nTo be clear, the concept of terrorism is nothing more than a legal justification for state-sponsored terrorism.",

Others seem to quite literally have taken control over various police departments, giving them the power and immunity to commit heinous acts that we have only just scratched the surface of. The FBI has admitted to being aware of all of this, and yet has refused to ever condemn the KKK or other white supremacists groups as the terrorists organizations they are.\nInstead, they have spent their resources on attempting to brand groups like BLM and ANTIFA as dangerous terrorist group, even going as far as to keep surveillance on members of those groups for years. \nPredictably, they have consistently failed to find any discernible threat with these groups, but have come out and begrudgingly said that the deadly threats they have regularly happened upon have nearly ALL been white supremacist-related. Some they are able to stop, and others become the latest mass shooting splashed across the news. \n\nMeanwhile, a number of black organization members and leaders have turned up dead under extremely suspicious circumstances.

The article says, \"Theoretically, the number could shrink with more tallying underway, but Biden's lead is expected to continue going up,\" which was already true on Saturday, and \"Biden is now up by 50,000 votes, which means that even if Trump's legal team is successful in getting courts to toss out 10,000 votes received between Election Day and Nov. 6, there's little chance they could actually alter the results,\" which doesn't pertain to the notion of an automatic recount.\n\n2) The [NYT data scraper](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#) estimates that there are 32,000 votes left to be counted in Pennsylvania. Biden's win margin is currently about 51,000 votes. If all the remaining votes went to Trump, Trump would trail by 19,000 votes, or about 0.3% of the total, which would trigger an automatic recount.

They are nice for walks and reflection. The history and meaning of those places, the death, struggle, pain, suffering, commradery, and sorrow is something that every American should experience. But I am often disappointed in my fellow countrymen that the fields and woods are often empty, long forgotten and discarded. Sacrifices made and blood spilled not honor, not mourned, not remembered.\n\nBut what is always at the forefront of people's mind, the \"history,\" is those stupid fucking statues on monument avenue. Those great leaders up on their horses. Those same men that sold lies to my ignorant ancestors, who were denied schooling, reading, writing, voting, and instead were told to work the land for mere penitence of their worth. They used them as cannon fodder and told them lies about the Yankees coming for their rights. Those men should be torn down or moved to the battlefields. Maybe then people would go and see and feel and hear those battles of brothers against one another. \n\nBut, I think not unfortunately.\nThey are really just buying into the old story of lost cause and the grand old south. Much like my family has done. Even with the knowledge that the landed gentry class manipulated  our ancestors to fight a battle that would continue to hold them down, they still believe in \"states rights\" , \"war of nothern agression\"  and whatever other crap they call it.\nMy family has been dirt floor poor white trash for ever until the last 50 years when we made it to the middle class and they still want to celebrate those men that help keep us down for so long. I hang my head in shame, but I celebrate these new laws that will tear down this legacy that has put a stain on the south.",

This has heavily contributed to the huge increasing wealth disparity between the top 1% and the rest of us. \n\nSince government actions are the primary reason for the increase in wealth of these millionaires and billionaires, it is only reasonable that increasing taxes (especially capital gain taxes) on this group and redistributing this new revenue to the rest of us including those at the bottom of the economic ladder seems fair.",

That everyone knows he’s capable of it proves he’s got to go.\n\nOnly 16 GOP Senators need to turn on someone who has zero power and who cost them two branches of government in four years, not to mention untold COVID deaths. That is very different from the Ukraine Affair. Schumer will also be in charge as Majority Leader. Ultimately, the Senate may not convict, but voting is about showing constituents where elected officials truly stand outside empty rhetoric.\n\nEdit: The Articles of Impeachment have been introduced and Democrats say they have the votes. Trump will be the first American president to be impeached twice. The question is the Senate trial on the question of removal, which requires a 2/3 vote.",

Elizabeth Warren plans to introduce legislation during this congressional session that would bar members of Congress and other top government officials from buying and selling individual stocks, she told Insider.\n\n\"It is a no-brainer,\" said Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. \"Every senator, member of Congress, president, Cabinet secretary, federal judge, and other senior officials in charge of writing the rules for our financial system should not be able to own or trade individual stocks.\"\n\nThe legislation would be based on the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which Warren introduced in 2018 and reintroduced in 2020, both times without Senate cosponsors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, sponsored companion legislation in the House last year.\n\nBoth Warren bills died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate Finance Committee.\n\nWhat's different now is that Democrats control the Senate, and Warren, who sits on the Finance Committee, has greater leverage to push the bill forward.\n\nNumerous members of Congress have come under scrutiny for their stock trades in recent months. They include Sens. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican; Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat; and former Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans of Georgia.\n\nRep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, went to federal prison last year after pleading guilty to insider-trading charges. But Collins served time for only a few weeks before President Donald Trump pardoned him in December.\n\nTop government officials, Warren said, \"are there to serve the people, not their personal financial interests.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Congress should pass anti-corruption legislation and restore American's faith in government by making it work for everyone — not just the rich and powerful.\"\n\nWarren did not offer a specific timetable for when she planned to introduce her stock-trading legislation this congressional session, which concludes in January 2023.",

The two worst times he was at point blank range and tried to get my face, but he got my neck because I turned away.  The second time he tried to sneak to my side and get me, but I still turned.  The second time he put the canister in either in my hair while spraying or it malfunctioned because it stopped spraying mist and just gurgled out liquid all over my neck and upper back.  That first night, I was covered in mace and pepperball residue.  I wasn't aware that water activates the chemicals.  I was already burning when I got home, but I have never screamed and cried like that before.  I wasn't able to finish cleaning myself before the pain became too much.  My entire body was on fire for some amount of time that was inconceivable to me during the process.  I was too scared to shower for another 48 hours or so.  I still didn't get it all off then.  My elbows still had residue last night and burned when I showered.  \n\nI never once made an aggressive move towards the cops.  I have been brutally punished for nothing.  Many of you know me in person.  Please take my word that the first three nights were filled with pointless police brutality.  This is why we're protesting.\"",

Thank God for democracy and thank you fellow Georgians for not making us complicit in maniacal tyranny. Being decent is not who you vote for, but rather how you treat those that vote differently.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you very much for all of the kind words and awards.  I merely voiced what hundreds of thousands of decent Georgians felt as they quietly did their civic duties, politics be damned.

                "comment": "I’ve been going over some of the Trump era rhetoric toward NATO. The 2018 summit got lost with all the other drama, but this bit is pretty prescient:\n\n> This past July, on the final day of the nato summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, proposed a closed-door emergency meeting. The emergency was Donald Trump. Minutes earlier, the President had arrived late to a session where the **Presidents of Ukraine and Georgia were making their case to join nato**. Trump interrupted their presentation and unleashed a verbal assault on the members of the alliance, calling them deadbeats and free riders on American power. Trump threatened to go his “own way” if they didn’t immediately pay more for their own defense. His barrage centered on Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving democratic leader.\n\nTrumo was looking for excuses to sour the US’s opinion of NATO, and idiots ate that up. He was undermining the alliance that is Putin’s number one problem. And what a coincidence that this outburst comes just as Ukraine and Georgia are making their case for membership. Hmmm….\n\n> “You, Angela,” Trump chided Merkel. Most of nato’s members had failed to fulfill the goal of spending two per cent of G.D.P. for defense, but Trump focussed on Germany’s military spending of just over one per cent of G.D.P. In front of television cameras the previous day, he had accused Germany of being “totally controlled by Russia,” because of a proposed new gas pipeline. His tweets that day sounded like blackmail. “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.”\n\nIn fact, the [US trade deficit with Europe had gone up during Trump’s tenure, and Europe had upped their NATO spending prior to Trump taking office](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/12/factchecking-trumps-nato-remarks/). Under Trump, it continued to go up, but they were under no obligation to do so and they had been doing that of their own accord. They didn’t owe us anything. \n\n>And yet, when he emerged from the meeting and spoke with reporters, Trump lied, claiming not only that his allies had capitulated to him but also that they would consider his demand to raise their annual military spending to four per cent of G.D.P., an assertion so politically impossible that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, immediately issued a public rebuttal. Trump, of course, went on behaving in his erratic, inexplicable manner. As he left the summit, he interrupted the Chancellor while she was addressing her fellow nato leaders, and kissed her. “I love this woman,” he said. “Isn’t she great?” A senior German official who told me about that particular Trumpian flourish resisted any attempt at full understanding. “It’s up to psychologists and historians what to make of that,” he said. Four days later, Trump ended his European tour in Helsinki. There, standing next to Vladimir Putin, he spoke with bewildering sympathy for Russian foreign policy, ill-concealed contempt for his nato partners, and implausible skepticism about his own intelligence services.\n\nSo Trump didn’t help our trade deficits with the EU, and NATO spending had been steadily increasing prior to his taking office. He verbally assaulted our allies and demeaned the NATO organization, causing it to lose stature and be seen as faltering or weak.\n\nHe didn’t care about Nord Stream, he cared about pissing Merkel off and he used their energy independence as a pretext for doing that. His sanction of a small Swiss firm who was working on a tiny fraction of the pipeline did nothing to stop the project. \n\nHis rantings were counter-productive and ineffectual, unless you’re a Russian. When you look back over Trump’s record on NATO, knowing what we do about Putin’s obesssive hatred for the alliance, his actions seem decidedly traitorous.",

These are such important lawsuits since this bullshit now is the root of all of the republican voter suppression laws that are sure to dictate who wins future elections. The damage fox news did is pretty much immeasurable and I wish they could be held truly accountable for what they did to all of us. \n\nJust winging this but I wonder if the US government could work with Dominion to require fox to run, not just retractions, but to completely clear the air on what happened by, convincing their audience that vote by mail is trustworthy and accurate last year and in the future because of its simplistic design where counties issue a single copy to a single voter and then tracked through the whole process. They then need to report on what the republicans are doing for the sole purpose of suppressing votes. \n\nTheres no doubt, some republican voters will think cheating through any means possible will think this is a great tactic and take their, ha ha, fuck you attitude to the polls, but honorable decent voters can at least be informed of what's going on and make their decisions on who to vote for in the future accordingly based on the actual facts. Its an absolute crime what fox is allowed to do right now by spreading disinformation about our election process and somehow, some way, it must be stopped",
