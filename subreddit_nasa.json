On this line of thought, I'm just wondering why 3 containers are used for fuel instead of more. Diminishing returns on construction or efficiency, perhaps?",

That's dirt that is on the lens. \n* Why can't they take off the lens cover? \n * They did after the dust settled (literally).\n* So why aren't there better pictures? \n * There are. Here's the[ first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/a0qi3n/insight_camera_deployment_first_image/) after they removed the lens cover, and all the raw images are available here.\n* Is Mars so small that I can easily see the curvature? \n * No, that's a very wide-angle lens and or possibly an artifact of the lens cover. If you look at the other image, you'll see the horizon appears flat.\n* Why was there no live video of it landing? \n * Primarily because the bandwidth to stream live video just isn't available. For spacecraft closer to earth, it's (relatively) easier to put higher-powered transmitters but more importantly you don't have to transmit as far, generally just a few hundred or few thousand miles. Amateur radio & TV stations can do that. Mars is currently around 91.6 million miles (147 million km) from earth and because of the [Inverse Square Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) it takes a lot more power to get the equivalent signal back to earth. (I'll leave the exact calculation to the folks at /r/theydidthemath)\n\nI'm happy to update this with any additions or corrections.\n\n#Edit: Thank you for the silver kind stranger!",

It was a clear night and I found a clearing where I could set up and watch the planets and stars for a bit.\n\nSince I was at a public camping site, there were a few people around. A family camped about 20 metres away from me, and the very young daughter took interest in what I was doing.\n\nSince Mars was sitting close to the horizon that night, I slewed the telescope his way for the daughter to see. I explained that Mars was usually interesting to look at but the dust storm made it look rather plain, and that there were two rovers hard at work so that the Earthlings could understand what was happening. \n\nI wish I could have bottled the wonder on the girl's eyes when I mentioned that we had two little cars on the surface of Mars. It made me love observing the night sky even more.\n\nOpportunity, thank you for everything you've done for humanity.",

I remember the thing that tickled him the most was telling us he invented the first toilet in outer space. Years later i look this up and that is credited to a different guy, but before that, there was a cruder system that i csnt find accredited to anyone and i suspect maybe that was his.
