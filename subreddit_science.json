All my life, though, I've been coming back to Physics and Math, doing some sporadic reading, wishing I could pursue either field seriously, because it always felt like they were fundamental to everything we see around us, and the universe in general. I never got around to doing anything about it, but this man is one of the big reasons I kept coming back. Just last night, some kind of spark was reignited for some reason, and I went back to a lot of old theory - rifling through my school textbooks, just enjoying the feeling of learning. I stayed up all night going from one resource to another, and the rabbit hole took me to Sabrina Pasterski and then [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09175.pdf) paper. I can't believe that just a few hours after that, the man who wrote it is gone.\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm rambling on. I'm in shock, and I guess I'm trying to say that I promise to never ignore my longing to learn science again. I will pursue it, if nothing else, to honor this great man. He gave his life to it, and gave us so much. With both my spirit and flesh willing, it's a crime to not commit. If you've actually read this far, I apologize for going on and on, but I promise you, whoever you are, that I'm going to try. And I will keep coming back to this post, this thread, and this great, great man's life whenever I wander away from this promise. I hope that one day, I can say with pride that Stephen Hawking inspired my scientific journey.\n\nRest in peace, sir. We will never let your name or your unmeasurable work and impact be forgotten. ",

                "comment": "Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the \"point of no return\" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than \"it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,\" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.",

Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.\n\n\nThis is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. \n\n\nThis is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).\n\nIn comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).\n\n\nWhat can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.\n\nEdit: There is an official White House petition you can sign to express your opposition: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/opposition-taxation-graduate-student-tuition-waivers-and-remissions\n\nAslo: https://medium.com/@avandervort/an-open-letter-to-the-senate-concerning-h-r-1-and-the-graduate-student-tax-provision-5ff7ace9262d\n\n ",

I understand that they should be going into majors where they can make that money back, but it's unrealistic to assume every single person wants to be a doctor or engineer. People should be smart about the loans they take out, but the loans shouldn't be 200k for a 4 year bachelors degree. \n\n\n\n\nAdd the fuel to the fire that is the inability to write off grad loans and it's absolutely going to pop that bubble sooner than later. It's inexplicable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: So I posted this at work and didn't have time to really check on it after a few replies and it suddenly became my highest upvoted comment to date. I just wanna thank my mom, my brothers, and my pet cat Dexter. But I also wanna say a few things. One, I am in absolutely **no way** specialized in this field of talk. I have rudimentary understandings of virtually everything I know in life so I apologize if anything in the original post was misinformed aka my terminology of this being a \"bubble\". Basically this cannot by definition be a bubble because the goods being bought with these loans cannot be traded and or refunded (I think? did I get that right guys?). \n\n\n\nAs far as the idea that people should be more responsible when taking out loans: I agree *to an extent*. I think parents and teachers of this generation (one which gets bashed at every possible moment) need to step the fuck up and teach their kids proper financing. I'm lucky that my mother did this for me. We weren't born into money but my mother worked her ass off with 4 kids to get her Masters in medicine to become a nurse practitioner, but that didn't happen until I was about 14 so she taught us good money habits from a super young age. BUT, even she didn't understand this college loan shit. Not until she started paying for some of it to help us out did she really understand what was happening. So, I think parents with kids that are 13-17 at the moment should be talking to their kids about student loans **right the fuck now**. Not about what they wanna be when they grow up. Not about what school they want to go to. But about how much money this entire system drains you of. \n\n\n\nThat's all from me for the night I might try replying to some more of you but I really didn't expect this comment to blow the fuck up.

The student takes real classes from real professors. Your tuition waiver as a PhD student gives you those classes for free. So you can say you did receive something of value you weren't taxed on.\n\nHowever, once these class requirements are fulfilled, the PhD. student is now a full time research a assistant. A reasonable person might expect that the student now gets the money that used to go to their classes. Nope! They get a small pay bump of a few thousand a year when they make this status change.\n\nIn effect, once the \"student\" becomes a full research assistant their pay is cut massively because they aren't getting the full benefit of their tuition waiver anymore. However, the \"student\" needs to keep their student status so they make the \"student\" register for \"thesis/research credits\" which are billed at the same rate as real classes. But there is no classroom, no curriculum no homework, no exams. It's just there to keep student status but they charge for this and then waive it! The student is no longer receiving any value, in fact they are receiving negative value! And now they want to tax this negative value? This is insane.",

That was money I made and it was only appropriate. \n\nThat is not what this is about.\n\nBut I never saw a dime of the $30k my university charged for tuition even in years when I wasn't taking coursework. They write themselves a credit for allowing me to be enrolled regardless of how I used that enrollment. For example, when I took a semester for maternity leave I had to stay enrolled. Thankfully my university covered my tuition that semester while I stayed home with the kid. \n\nIf that had not been the case I would have been taxed on $15k that semester while I didn't take a single course, attend a single lecture, use the library, or anything else. And I definitely didn't get any portion of that $15k in my bank account. \n\nThere are a lot of broken things about higher education.

They just \"forgive\" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don't have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.\n\nFor the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.\n\n**The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of \"perks of a job\". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply \"common leasing rates\"?\n\n**The justification**: You can't just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as \"gift\", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)\n\nIn this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.\n\n**The flaw**:\nTHe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.  \nedit: Additional flaw: It doesn't work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn't force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)\n\n**Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.\n\n**Additional observation**:\nThe above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn't address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.\n\n**Tl;dr** :\n\nJust calling it a 300% increase is dishonest and misses the issue in an effort to foster outrage.",

So they basically pay taxes on money they've never seen and never will see. \n2) REPEALS THE STUDENT INTEREST LOAN DEDUCTION. EVERYONE with student loans who makes under 80k (160K) for couples should be against this. It takes away $2500 of deductible income from you every year. \n3) FREE TUITION BENEFITS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS GET TAXED AS INCOME.

If you make 50K and you have two kids in college at the same time for 50K each, you'll get taxed as if you had 150K worth of income.

Further there is the real problem of inspiring students into STEM courses. Maybe now those bright students will turn to degrees that pay more earlier in their career. Why study physics when there is a fortune to be made as a surgeon or as a dentist. I would love to know the thinking behind the proponents enthusiasm for this backward measure.",

The findings were published in the journal [Economic Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517652200283X).\n\nA large body of research suggests that physical appearance has an impact on a person’s success. For example, attractive people tend to earn more money and report higher life satisfaction than less attractive people. Interestingly, scholars have yet to agree on the explanation behind this beauty premium.\n\nOne account suggests that the beauty advantage can be explained by discrimination. For example, employers may inherently favor attractive over unattractive workers. Another perspective suggests that beauty is a productivity-enhancing attribute. This view suggests that attractiveness lends itself to higher productivity, for example, through increased self-confidence.\n\n“I’m interested in discrimination generally,” said Adrian Mehic, a graduate student at Lund University and the author of the new study. “In economics research, lots of attention is given to discrimination based on gender and/or race. While these are important issues, there has not been much research on beauty-based discrimination in the educational setting, so the paper fills a gap there.”\n\n“Also, the pandemic made discrimination based on appearance much more difficult, since teachers could not readily see students’ faces. Whereas discrimination on for instance gender is possible in the online setting also, as long as you have the names of students.”",

Of course with a headline like that it is going to attract readers from both within and outside academia, and some of the readers wont be able to tell if the research has been done properly or not. \nAdrian Mehic is now under investigation from the National Research Ethics Board for not conducting ethical research.\n\n The most disturbing part is that it was conducted without the subjects knowing they were part of the study, and therefore without their consent. Big no no. \nFuthermore the level of attractivness was decided by him going through the subjects social media and picking out what ge thougt were the most attractive pictures of them. These pictures were then sent to a \"jury\" consisting of about 70 persons, of which about half were high schoolers (!) to rate their attractiveness. As mention, all of this were done without their knowledge and is as a whole pretty skewed way to rate attractiveness. \n\nIn his \"study\" he also dosnt mention that the absolut main part (in general 70-90%) of the students grades are decided by their final exams, which are only identified by their student IDs. The teacher grading never know which test belongs to which student and at lunds University they are in general not present at the final exams, except for like 10-15 min to answer a question or two. \n\nObligatory Sorry for bad formatting and english, im writing from my phone in the bath.",

Attractiveness gives way to what's known as the \"halo effect\" , that a bias in the person perceiving the attractiveness begins to associate a whole wealth of positive traits to that person. The attractive person could be average in intelligence, but the halo effect would make someone think that because they're beautiful they must also be smart, confident, kind, compassionate, a good mother/father, good at business, etc etc.\n\nThere's already a bias in the workplace where once women have children, career advancement and pay tends to come to a halt compared to single women, whereas men who father children tend to see gains in pay and career advancement compared to their single counterparts. I've always wondered if that played into the halo effect as well (e.g. a male supervisor looking to sexualize an employee but holds off on women he views as other men's property or ruined by motherhood vs men needing to be breadwinners to provide for his wife and children.)\n\nThe halo effect causes massive disparities in pay even without counting for racial/gender disparities. Attractive people are seen to make up to 20% more than unattractive people. Being overweight or obese alone can add an additional 5-10% reduction in pay.\n\nMind you, I graduated high school in '07 and college in '12, So I feel like we've made strides in terms of social tolerance and acceptance. This was just what I had researched at the time.",

                "comment": ">The results next revealed that the switch to online instruction eliminated the beauty premium — but only for female students. For non-quantitative courses, attractive female students saw a decline in their grades with remote instruction, while attractive male students continued to enjoy a beauty advantage.\n\n>According to the study author, these findings suggest that discrimination most likely explains the beauty premium for female students, who no longer had higher grades when classes turned remote. But for male students, who continued to see higher grades with attractiveness even when student-teacher interaction was low, beauty seems to be a productivity-enhancing attribute.\n\nI really question this interpretation, given that attractive male students didn't perform any better in quantitative course (math and physics) than their less-attractive peers.\n\nIt's possible that their inherent confidence carried over more and boosted them, but it's also possible that female students' attractiveness mostly aides them when they are physically present as opposed to their male counterparts.",

Considering the study was attemtping to test if adult university lecturers were taking beauty into account it's strange to let high schoolers define how attractive the students were.\n\nThe rating was done on photos taken from facebook, which introduces confounding factors. None of the students or teachers were informed about the study and no consent was asked. No ethics review was performed.",

I'd say they connect killing people in game with killing in real world and thus they rightly think it's bad and wrong. While I'm not mad at them or anything for thinking about it like this I do think differently.\n\nI think that I'm just not perceiving it as / connecting it to killing or brutality.

UV light damages plastic parts in your AC system so think it through what parts will be exposed to UV light.\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the up votes (wow 2800 in two hours!) but especially for those who contributed context in the comments below. \nWhile I cannot possibly highlights all the good contributions, I'd like to summarize a few points:\n\n* AC air moves fast so it's important to have the UV light in the right place. Commercial HVAC systems have dedicated units in the right places for this sterilization. \n\n* UV light in the AC system will impact some virus that circulates through the system, but only if it is slow moving air to give it enough time to be exposed to UV-C light, and it does nothing to the air a sick person just spread around the room before it cycles via your AC. There is an air ionization option out there to disinfect air in the room, but not without [their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kd67rx/-/gfvcryl) risks.\n\n* Blacklight is a form of UV light (UV-A) and it's what a lot of LED strips are and are harmless both to humans and viruses.

                "comment": "HVAC engineer here. This probably isn’t practical. Most settings you would use this for (say a section of a mall or hospital) would be moving (rough approximation) at least 10,000CFM (cubic feet per minute) across the unit coil or main ducts. Air volumes this large would expect the air to be moving up to 2000 feet per minute through the system (assuming VAV system. it may be a constant volume rooftop system that would have slightly lower air velocity, but still wouldn’t work for more reasons). So simple math- 2,000 FPM, needs 30 seconds of exposure, that leads to a 1,000ft run of UV light to reach that 99%. Yes, maybe shorter exposure time will still lead to at least some neutralization, but the lengths of light required would still be massive and probably beyond the length of the longest main duct runs of most systems. \n\nThis doesn’t even take into account that hospitals require their HVAC systems to be 100% outside air (aka all air entering the AHU is from the outside, and all the air in the hospital gets exhausted back to the outside). (EDIT: as pointed out, this last sentence was not entirely true, there is some recirculation of air in certain rooms in hospitals. I’d still categorize a hospital in the same category as my next sentence however) Mass gathering areas in general (like a mall), require a significant percentage of fresh outside air as well.\n\nEdit: and for in home applications, typically the air is moving in the 500-1000FPM range. Using the quick math above, still not practical",

To my knowledge, nobody in our company has specified one for a COVID retrofit, nor has anyone explored it for new construction as a reaction to the pandemic.\n\nUV sections for air handlers are huge, and require a lot of extra static pressure at the fan to overcome the added friction. This idea is basically DOA.\n\nPutting them in ducts would require installing at the mains before any branches tap off, these ducts typically have air moving 1000-1800 feet per minute. That's 500-900 feet of duct that would be required to be lined with UV bulbs.  In the unlikely event you actually had that much available, the cost and disruption to install them would be a nightmare.\n\nWorth noting that in a hospital (EDIT: in the US and anywhere else that follows ASHRAE), patient care areas require MERV 14 filtration which removes about 75% of particles 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter anyway, so there's really no reason to install such a huge and costly system for incremental improvement. Only worth it if you can improve to *total removal* of the virus.\n\nHEPA filters are *practically* 100% effective at removing viruses and much easier to design to fit, so that remains the approach where we feel that level of air scrubbing is necessary.",

So many people from top tier universities talk about how “hard” it was growing up, and make it sound like landing that quarter-mil salary was some herculean uplifting from abject poverty. The right target questions will penetrate this often unrealized facade without them even noticing.\n\nAsk questions like “what rank was your high school?”, or “what kind of SAT prep did you have to do?”, or “what extracurriculars were you in?” Asking about jobs they held in high school and college are also good ones. People tend to overlook how overwhelmingly their background is colored by their parents’ wealth, so asking “what” questions like this can cut through their own personal ego to excise the details of what their family could afford, which as we now know has *everything* to do with future earning potential. In tech it’s noticeable, as people from wealthy families can afford to take greater risks to reap greater rewards, because the floor is so much higher if they fail thanks to family wealth that one can fall back on.",

Yet while this ‘intergenerational self’ partially reflects the lived experience of multigenerational upward mobility, it also acts – we argue – as a means of deflecting and obscuring class privilege\n\nSo their origin story goes back to their parent's working class upbringings, and that is how they see their construct their own origin story. \"My grandparents were working class farmers, but with grit we have overcome these limitations and made success for ourselves\" is the way they frame it, not \"When I was born my family was privileged\".",

Its very specific to the British and states as much noting that in most of Western Europe and the US the phenomenon isn't observed  (presumably as much).\n3. It has nothing to do with the \"Wealthy\".\n\nCurious to know where the title came from, was it the original title that was then subsequently changed by the publication? - if not it seems to be breaking rule #3. It'd be like if my comment was: This title is misrepresenting itself in order to exacerbate class conflict and generate free interweb awards. The amount of cross posts tho make me think this was a clickbait original title, that rapidly amended itself once it cross-polinated enough. Well played sagepub...",

In this paper, we introduce and make available a new data set containing the activity logs that recorded all activity for 309 Reddit users for one year. Using this newly collected data, we present findings that highlight the browsing and voting behavior of the study’s participants. We find that most users do not read the article that they vote on, and that, in total, 73% of posts were rated (i.e., upvoted or downvoted) without first viewing the content. We also show the evidence of cognitive fatigue in the browsing sessions of users that are most likely to vote.\n",

So they proposed this idea to a wet suit making company to test it using ethical methods of using non-humanoid objects that had the stripes and food inside to see if the sharks noticed any difference. They could not \"see\" the stripes because it seemed to kind of deter their vision or just act as a blind spot compared to the objects that did not have stripes.

They claim this is cheaper, and yet in the long run, we still end up having to raise taxes. \n\nThe problem is government contracts. Many times they end up being awarded to \"aquaintances\" of the politicians, or contributors to thier campaign funds. Many times, companies will simply be created to fulfill these contracts, and the money poured into them at excessive cost, as a way to embezzel taxpayer money. One example of this was the initial IT programs for the Navy and Marines Corps which was awarded to EDS, Ross Perot's company. Under these contracts, early buisness class PC's and laptop workstations were rented to the Navy and Marine Corps under the banner of NMCI (Navy Marines Corps Internet). These machines which were no more powerful than a typical $800 buisness class machine were rented from EDS on a monthly basis for upwards of 48 to 72 months at upwards of $1200 to $1400 dollars a month. The first months rent literally paid for the machine, but each consecutive months payment was said to have paid for the ongoing services provided, even though a machine might very well serve it's entire lifespan without any further service aside from updates. For a single workstation at $1200 and for 48 months, that comes out to $57,600. Multiply that by hundreds of thousands of workstations, and you see where this is going. For 500,000 workstations, that's $28.8 billion dollars to outsource IT related needs. Granted, much of this is actually used to pay employees, to pay for access to main internet connections and such, but there are also riders in these contract that cover certain things, so the money that is claimed to come from the main budget of the contract is already covered .\nFor privitized prisons, they operate somewhat like a hotel. While they are federally funded, they also collects fees from the prisoners themselves on a monthly basis. $5-$10 doesn't sound like much until your a prisoner with no way to make money. Prisoners are charged on a daily basis, and many times leave prision in debt they are unable to pay, and much of the time ends up falling on thier family to pick up affecting more than just the prisoner. An inmate at Brown County Jail in Wisconson racked up a $17000 debt after a nearly 2 year stay. These pay to stay prisons are an incentive to pack the prison with inmates lending to the corruption of the legal justice system, and even help to feed racial discrimination.",

When they got home they tended to immediately get incarcerated again, doing the exact same thing. \n\nIm assuming this was a special location. It just seems like it would be great to implement it on a larger scale for prisons. When the juveniles were involved with the program they were doing so much better.

That would just be Insanity so let's look at everything we can but that to try to solve this issue. Because we know are diverse country couldn't possibly produce stats like: less than 13% (really its 3%, young black men between 18-34) of the population committing over half of the murders. Or more police officers are killed every year by minorities than the contrary. Yet somehow we still pretend like they're the victims as they victimized everyone around them, including the supposed police who are pressing them. Cops get shot all the time here in Philly and nobody marches for them. But a knife-wielding maniac charges at a cop and gets himself killed and they burn this city down because he's a victim. \n\nLet's tie ourselves in knots to try to get those numbers down so we can feel better about the disparity in crime  in cities like mine. All you people in the suburbs don't have to deal with that stuff anyway oh, so you can just pretend it's the system's fault. Let's ignore the fact that completely dirt poor white people from similar circumstances (or worse, VS minorities) in the Appalachian Mountains (one of the poorest areas in the USA), who tend to own loads of firearms, aren't running around killing each other at abominable rate.  So we can't blame poverty. But since we can't say crime is a cultural issue because that's racist, let's turn our eyes to the police and the government\n\nPeople like me will just keep having our cars broken into, our homes vandalized over who we voted for in political elections, our store shelves being completely emptied for fear that they'll be looted just making us travel miles to get a decent selection. Then of course the NORMAL stuff like murders, rapes, overdoses, and rampant drug dealing.\n\nMeanwhile you big brain types are sitting out in your $400,000 homes in the suburbs trying to figure out how you can make these people spend less time in prison.

If you sit in a warm bath then immediately hop in a cool one, you'll probably think the cool one was god damned ice water. You go on a cleanse and your body feels like garbage, but them you feel normal again and you think your just had an orgy with every person in your bucket list at the same time.\n\nIf I had to guess how happy they actually were I'd say depending on the child and how much interaction they have with them afterward, I'd place the average somewhere between \"as happy\" and \"slightly happier\" but only so much as having an extra friend or twonwpuld bring.\n\nYes, you're going to have those that are outliers, people who have this profound connection with their family (Christmas movie level), people who basically throw their children out the door because they were terrible (either the parenting or the child), people who loved being parents but their children never see them after they move out, etc.\n\nIn the end the big questions when it comes to children should be \"Do I want children?\" and \"Am I capable of properly caring for them?\". If you don't want kids, don't have them, simple. If you aren't capable of raising them, find out why and see if you can become capable.",

The age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 77 years, though the majority were adults.\n\nWith this: \n\n>All of the non-epileptic patients had been treated with anti-seizure medication for two to four weeks following their first seizure, and none of them had a recurrence of seizures after stopping their exposure to essential oils. And 94% of the epileptic patients also remained seizure-free during the follow-up period.\n\nAlong with this: \n\n>**The authors emphasized in the paper that this is a topic that has not been well studied, and that it needs significantly more research**, as essential oils are used all over the world.

                "comment": "Alright, for those of you that need an ELI5 for the actual science, buckle up.\n\n> We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity.\n\nAlright. We know what mutations are, right? A change in the structure of a gene? Sometimes there's a *microdeletion*, which is the loss of a tiny piece of genetic material that may be too small to be seen readily through a microscope. You have to use really specialized imaging methods (e.g. high-resolution chromosome banding, molecular chromosome analysis (with FISH), or DNA analysis). \n\nThere's also this thing called a single-nucleotide polymorphism (or SNP, pronounced \"snip\"), which is a change in a single base pair in the DNA. SNPs are natural in the genome, occurring about once every 1000 base pairs. While they technically have no effect on health or development (not in the same way that other mutations do), they can predict an individual’s response to certain drugs, susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, and risk of developing particular diseases. \n\nNow onto what this FAAH thing is. Fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the major catabolic enzyme for a range of bioactive lipids called fatty-acid amides (FAAs). As a refresher, \"catabolic enzymes\" break things down into smaller parts and release energy. These FAAs act as ligands for cannabinoid receptors (i.e. endocannabinoids). In mice, when you knock out FAAH altogether, they have a decreased pain response to acute thermal stimuli, and show reduced pain when you introduce inflammation-causing agents. This is really important because manipulating FAAH has mostly worked in *animals*, but most clinical trials that manipulate FAAH in *humans* has failed, for one reason or another. \n\nNow, contrasting to that, when you introduce this particular SNP into FAAH, it significantly reduces the activity of FAAH, and somehow has an enhanced effect on fear-extinction learning while decreasing anxiety-linked behaviors. This is important because it matches the phenotype of the case study patient, who doesn't actually appear to learn \"fire = hot\" like other people do, because she has had a gradual decrease in reaction to stimuli that most people are averse to (heat, pain, etc). \n\nSo, to put this all together, the researchers here hypothesize that because of the *combination* of a microdeletion (a tiny piece of missing DNA) and a SNP (one base pair difference) in the FAAH coding genes, this lady has a decreased or nonexistent pain response to what would normally be painful experiences (e.g. surgery).\n\nSo, onto the results:\n\n> Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH. \n\nWhat they're basically saying is that, molecules that are normally broken down by FAAH and not seen in blood, are present in her blood, leading the researchers to believe that the mutation is doing exactly what they thought it did.\n\nOne of the important things here is that the chromosomal area that codes FAAH was previously thought to be a \"junk\" sequence, meaning that it's basically there to take up space. This does open the door to a more detailed search of \"junk\" sequences to see if they're actually encoding useful things.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Concerns? I hope I explained this simply enough!",

                "comment": "It almost feels as if this sub should avoid posting phase 1 vaccine studies because so few people seem to be able to interpret what’s going on. A few things to note: this is a phase 1 trial looking at adverse effects (side effects) graded on the basis of self reporting at a single site in Wuhan, China and 90%+ patients were young healthy 30-somethings. Even still, while there were almost no grade 3+ AEs recorded, almost all patients did experience negative effects (which they describe as medium to mild but could very well be more severe given the testing site) and only half the patients managed to produce a 4x increase from baseline of neutralizing antibodies after a month. So the main takeaway is that this vaccine doesn’t seem to kill anyone and it seems to illicit an immune response in about half of all patients tested. That’s not bad but it’s not great either, results should be taken not with a grain but with a rock of salt. \n\n>> Currently, correlates of protection for a vaccine against COVID-19 are unknown, and the roles of the specific antibodies or T cells in building effective protection are not yet defined. Therefore, we are unable to predict the protection of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine on the basis of the vaccine-elicited immune responses in this study. However, previous studies investigating SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that the increases in specific antibodies were temporary, and declined quickly in patients after recovery, whereas the specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses played an essential role in immunity.17,  18 A similar rapid decline of the specific antibody amounts in patients with COVID-19 after recovery was also noted,19,  20 suggesting that both specific cellular and humoral immunity are potentially important for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we only report the data within 28 days after the vaccination, but we are going to follow up the vaccine recipients for at least 6 months, so more data will be obtained.\n\nIn other words we don’t even know if these antibodies will confer any kind of protection and if they do, how long that protection will last. SARS and MERS are both deadly coronaviruses that have been with us for years but we have been thus far unsuccessful in developing a vaccine. MERS is actually substantially more deadly than either SARS or COVID but it can only be transferred to humans by camels (not from one person to another) so we’ve directed less firepower at that target. The point is that nobody has developed an effective coronavirus vaccine and I don’t think any candidate has made it beyond phase 1b. \n\n>> Interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up, and the absence of a randomised control group. As it was a first-in-human study of the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, it was not designed to measure the vaccine efficacy. However, in preclinical studies, seven out of eight ferrets were protected from having detectable virus copies when challenged by SARS-CoV-2 through nasal dripping 21 days after immunisation with the vaccine, whereas only one out of eight ferrets in the control group was negative for virus copies (Wei C, unpublished). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine in healthy adults, with no interference by underlying diseases or medicines. *However, results of our study indicated that older age could have a negative effect on the vaccine-elicited responses to SARS-CoV-2.* In this trial, no participants were older than 60 years and only 16% of the participants were older than 50 years, providing limited information on the capability of generating a potent cellular and humoral response in the older population. Since age has also been identified as an independent risk factor for severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,4,  22 and there is a possibility that an even lower immune response might be found in the older population, we are going to include participants who are older than 60 years in the phase 2 study considering this population as an important target population for a COVID-19 vaccine. *Additionally, experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have raised concerns about the antibody-dependent enhancement in participants who are infected with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination.23* However, this study was not statistically powered to measure any safety outcome, especially for the concerns around immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement events associated with the full-length spike glycoprotein vaccine antigen.24 *Our study found that the pre-existing Ad5 immunity could slow down the rapid immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also lower the peak of the responses, particularly for humoral immunity.* The high pre-existing Ad5 immunity might also have a negative effect on the persistence of the vaccine-elicited immune responses. In previous studies, heterologous prime-boost combinations or homologous prime-boost regimens with Ad5 vectored vaccines were shown to be able to induce more strong and durable immunogenic responses in populations with high pre-existing Ad5 immunity.25,  26,  27 Nevertheless, limited information is available for the effects of multiple doses of the candidate Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in humans, which warrants further investigation.\n\nEmphasis add by me, numbers are footnote references, I was too lazy to remove them and encourage everyone to actually read the study if they have the scientific literacy to interpret most of it. This trial is interesting, certainly, but has little practical value wrt our current approach to fighting COVID. There are still too many unknowns to determine one way or another that a vaccine will be a viable solution to fighting this pandemic.",

I understand this is a pandemic, but vaccines need to be safe first and foremost.\n\n\"Gary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, was not surprised by the findings:\n\n“This was the assumption and they are just demonstrating that the assumption was correct,” he told STAT, adding that he doesn’t expect this vaccine to succeed.\n\nKobinger said CanSino — which also produced an Ebola vaccine using this viral vector — has argued it could override the problem of preexisting immunity by using higher doses of the vaccine or using an intra-nasal delivery mechanism, rather than injecting the vaccine into muscle. (In this study, the vaccine was injected.)\n\nBut in the highest of the three doses used in this study, the number of side effects was high — 75% of the people in the highest dose arm reported at least one side effect. Side effects included fever — some higher than 101.3, which is considered a Grade 3 or serious side effect — pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, among others. Ten volunteers had Grade 3 side effects, representing 9% of the overall study group, with 17% of the people in the arm receiving the highest dose of vaccine reporting Grade 3 reactions.\" [https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/22/early-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-developed-in-china-sees-mixed-results/](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/22/early-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-developed-in-china-sees-mixed-results/)",

The water turns the cement powder into interlocking crystals that bind the other ingredients together.\n\nThere are a lot of recipes for concete, but the typical \"ordinary Portland Cement\" concrete is made with a cement that starts with about 5 parts limestone to 1 part shale.  These are burned in a high temperature kiln, which converts them chemically to a product that reacts with water.\n\nLots of other materials will do this too.  The ancient Romans dug up rock that had been burned by a volcano near Pozzolana, Italy.  The general category is thus called \"Pozzolans\". Coal furnace ash and blast furnace slag are also rocks that have been burned.  They have long been used as partial replacements for Portland Cement.  Rich husk ash and brick dust are other, less common, alternative cements.\n\nNote: Natural coal isn't pure carbon.  It has varying amounts of rock mixed in with it. That's partly because the coal seams formed that way, and partly because the mining process sometimes gets some of the surrounding bedrock by accident.\n\nPortland Cement got its name because the concrete it makes resembled  the natural stone quarried in Portland, England at the time.",

All three of the specialty ingredients are likely from somewhere not local, which is a big part of the cost of concrete. Also, the last time I read about using burned/charred fiber materials, there was a positive effect only up to about 5%, then it killed compressive strength rapidly.  We looked into using something similar from a wood saw mill, that burned their sawdust for their kilns, creating a char material. \n\nAlso is the limestone crushing waste further processed at all, like sieving for particle sizes? Product uniformity is a major requirement in concrete, which requires exacting standards of reliable, repeatable results. And finally, silica sand is just like saying \"sand sand.\" Sand is mostly made up of siliceous quartz, but often with a wide variety of other durable minerals mixed into it. Does this mean they need a pure silica sand? If so that is major processing and again, specialized production. \n\nConcrete almost always reflects the availability of local, generic materials. Distance to source quarries is so important, I find that most plants are just down the road from one. Diesel is not cheap, and most cement is brought in from central rail locations for distribution. There will always be someone willing to pay the extra cost for super specialty applications (see mixes for nuclear waste storage), but economy of the product will always be the drive for 99% of concrete.",

                "comment": "All well and good...but the article completely ignores that all concrete framed structures require steel reinforcing for tensile strength, which un-reinforced concrete lacks.  Various formulas can provide a fairly broad range of compressive strength, its chief advantage.\n\nCracking...it's what concrete does under stress loading.  As one first tier structural engineer said, \"it has the tensile strength of blue cheese.\"  Not quite so bad.\n\nIf you've ever been on a construction site involving masonry you might have noticed experienced masons cracking bricks in half with a quick sharp blow on a brick chisel, resulting in a fairly clean edge at the break.  Homogenous material does that.  Aggregated material also can be split though with rougher edges...the cement cracks, the stone aggregate mostly doesn't.  Same with terra cotra floor tiles, aided with a scored line at the desired point.\n\nDepending on the width, depth, and location of the concrete crack, the situation at best might be merely annoying or something more serious.  That said all cracks exposed to weather conditions allowing water to enter, especailly in climates subject to freezing temperatures or salt water spray ultimately cause corrosion of the steel reinforcing members, leading to a weaken of the structure over time...which can be years, less if the stresses are of a larger magnitude.\n\nWhat the brief PR release also doesn't mention is the effect of the new formula on transferred impact energy.  Does the resilience dampen the frequency of energy transmission throughout the structure?  Would be very interesting to see the data of physical charteristics under the massive military effects, which seem to be the main point of the research.  \n\nVery interesting but otherwise, it seems to be a third world solution where cost of fiberglass reinforcing is a cost consideration...or are there vast secret coconut plantations in the Russian Federation of which western intelligent services are unaware.    Show us full scale test mock ups of bridges, bunkers, etc....tested to destruction as all current systems have endured.",

Mixtures were being forced to change to ones used in much warmer states due to being slightly environmentally more friendly and a small handful of other issues. However, since by design these were more porous and made for areas where temperatures above freezing are yearly lows resulting in colder areas the asphalt shattering at first snow fall. This means it would need replaced every year causing extra headache to workers, commuters, the state, damage to cars before holes could be patched, and the greater need completely negated the environment friendly benefits. \n\nThe quality of paved roads does need to be regulated so we don't have cheap companies making cheap and dangerous roads, but making one universal mix is not the solution when environments are wildly different.

                "comment": "Serious question: The study assumes that expanding to single-payer healthcare would work just like medicare. But medicare exists in the context of an insurance market where there is some competition and market pressure to adjust prices. For example, if a hospital started charging a lot more for some procedure than other hospitals they might be dropped from the \"network\" of some insurance carriers.\nHence, the prices medicare pays for procedures is somewhat adjusted by what those same procedures cost on the free market. \n\nHowever, if we have a single payer system, who decides on the prices? Will healthcare providers be able to charge whatever they want? Or, will the government set the prices and that's what providers get.\n\nIn the first case, what prevents a hospital from just milking the system to charge whatever they want? On the second option, what the hospital gets paid is completely unrelated to the quality of service or other investments, so there is never a financial incentive to invent new procedures or upgrade facilities. In fact, the only incentive for a hospital would be to cut costs as much as possible since a flat payment would be paid regardless of whether you have a 1-hour or a 10-hour wait to treat someone in the ER.\n\nObviously healthcare is far from a perfect market, but without zero market pressures, how will this system prevent terrible inefficiencies?\n\nEdit: Thanks for those awesome replies! The day has come where I get to say RIP my inbox. I read all of it but likely won’t be able to respond. Maybe some time later I can read through the down-thread responses. I’ve learned a lot more about the system and the ideas, but I’m still not sure who is ultimately right.",

And we can expand medicare as much as we want, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of our current system.  For literally hundreds of technological reasons.\n\nHealthcare is the biggest industry in the United States, valued at 9 trillion.  Directly private payors employ several millions of people, but then you get into marketing, consulting, hospital liasons, technical support, customer support, project management, software engineering... the hundreds of software companies supporting American healthcare and its private payors...\n\nYou're looking at millions and millions of people who don't have a job and have no where to go.  Take into account that good employment growth, per month, on a national level, is 150,000 people.  Now imagine millions now unemployed.  The government would lose billions of tax revenues it would need to support this multi-trillion dollar annual cost of supporting a single payer system.\n\nUnited Health is a fortune 100 and the bedrock of the majority of healthcare mutual funds, that comprise a massively significant amount of American's 401ks and Roth IRAs.  Healthcare is one of the stones of the bedrock of American retirement.  All of a sudden these companies are gone... You think this will just pass?  When Boeing can't produce 747's any more, our economy faced (well, is still facing) a massive stagnation because of it (mostly the DOW.  Literally once the news broke the DOW dropped 150 points in a single day).  Now imagine a company 3 times the size of Boeing being removed.  permanently.  Then we move on to the hundreds of other private payor companies...\n\nPlease show me where you got the numbers for your last paragraph.  I will counter with government data (Bernie is EXTREMELY, almost negligently, loose with his figures).\n\nWhen Obama implemented the value-based system 8 years ago, hospitals are JUST NOW starting to learn how to adopt those practices (away from the fee-for-service model).  It will probably be another 15 years before we are fully compliant with value-based, and this transition is absolutely dwarfed by the conceptual change of single payer.\n\nI work for a health system, who will always have a revenue cycle, so I will never be out of a job.  \n\nAs much as I wish we had a single payer system, I am telling you, it will NEVER, EVER happen.\n\nBernie is pandering, while also trying to push really far with this idea because he knows he will have to walk it back.  Elizabeth Warren, despite her other faults, is atleast hedging her bets and admits she \"can see a world with an expanded medicare and private payors competing\".\n\nThis is ALL before we get into the constitutionality of the president absorbing a non-monopoly industry.\n\nIt will never, ever, EVER, happen.",

Survival analysis of the time to autism diagnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccination status, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score).\n\n>**Results:**  During 5 025 754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence rate, 129.7 per 100,000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination.\n\n>**Limitation:**  No individual medical chart review was performed.\n\n>**Conclusion:**  The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.\n\n>**Primary Funding Source:**  Novo Nordisk Foundation and Danish Ministry of Health.\n\n",

My son is doing well in school, he's developing just fine in spite of the challenges and the reason behind his ASD is moot to me. I don't get the fear of ASD.
