Darth Senate was a Dark Senate of the Senate, so powerful and so wise he could use the Senate to influence the senate to create senate... He had such a knowledge of the dark senate that he could even keep the senate he cared about from dying. The dark senate of the senate is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his senate, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his senate everything he knew, then his senate killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",

                "comment": "Risk factors\n\nFactors that may increase your risk of colon cancer include:\n\nOlder age. Colon cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but a majority of people with colon cancer are older than 50. The rates of colon cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.\n\nAfrican-American race. African-Americans have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races.\n\nA personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. If you've already had colon cancer or noncancerous colon polyps, you have a greater risk of colon cancer in the future.\n\nInflammatory intestinal conditions. Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can increase your risk of colon cancer.\n\nInherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk. Some gene mutations passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon cancer significantly. Only a small percentage of colon cancers are linked to inherited genes. The most common inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome, which is also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).\n\nFamily history of colon cancer. You're more likely to develop colon cancer if you have a blood relative who has had the disease. If more than one family member has colon cancer or rectal cancer, your risk is even greater.\n\nLow-fiber, high-fat diet. Colon cancer and rectal cancer may be associated with a typical Western diet, which is low in fiber and high in fat and calories. Research in this area has had mixed results. Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat diets high in red meat and processed meat.\n\nA sedentary lifestyle. People who are inactive are more likely to develop colon cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of colon cancer.\n\nDiabetes. People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nObesity. People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer and an increased risk of dying of colon cancer when compared with people considered normal weight.\n\nSmoking. People who smoke may have an increased risk of colon cancer.\n\nAlcohol. Heavy use of alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy for cancer. Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon cancer.\n\nPrevention\n\nScreening colon cancer\n\nDoctors recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer consider colon cancer screening around age 50. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer, should consider screening sooner.\nSeveral screening options exist — each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you.\n\nLifestyle changes to reduce your risk of colon cancer\n\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of colon cancer by making changes in your everyday life. Take steps to:\n\nEat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may play a role in cancer prevention. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get an array of vitamins and nutrients.\n\nDrink alcohol in moderation, if at all. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day for women and two for men.\n\nStop smoking. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit that may work for you.\n\nExercise most days of the week. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight. If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy ways to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by increasing the amount of exercise you get and reducing the number of calories you eat.\n\n\nMake sure you know the dangers and get checked, my Dad is going through this at the moment.\n\nMany men feel uncomfortable about colon, prostate, testicular cancer etc never feel embarrassed about your health, never feel that way, your health is more important than anything else. \n\nRIP Chadwick Boseman, you got to see your impact on the world, but were taken too soon by a cruel disease.",

I don't care if Will Forte was Shaggy or Amanda Seyfreid was Daphne or Zac Efron was Fred and I don't care how well they did. Those other VO's have been doing the voice for decades.\n\nWhere I disagree is that voice acting is acting.

They were professional voice actors. We had Will Friedle as one and Cree Summer as another. But they were there just to fill in before the parts were cast with \"big name actors\". Will Friedle in particular was hilarious. He brought so much to his temporary role, he added stuff himself that they ended up keeping in the script. And I felt kind of bad for him that he was this good and then they got a live action actor in to just rerecord his lines, and he never got the recognition he deserved for that. His performance was just fantastic. He got to do a couple of incidental voices in the final cut. But he should have been the character that he did the scratch records for. It was also pretty jarring to hear someone else in the final film after Cree had absolutely made that role her own. Now I'm not knocking the final actors, they were good. But I personally feel like Will Friedle and Cree Summer should have played their scratch characters in the final film. I also got super excited when I realised it was Will Friedle. I was a big Boy Meets World fan. I told the directors and anyone else I could find that day to tell them that OH MY GOD ERIC FROM BOY MEETS WORLD IS DOING THE SCRATCH!

Much like Ginnifer Goodwin, who I only know from Once Upon a Time, playing a rabbit to the point where I can only see her in the role of a rabbit just as much as only Jason Bateman can play a sly fox.\nThat being said, give the legitimately trained voice actors the chance to flex, they are practically celebrities in this modern internet age.

That was my personal favorite), sometimes it's dinosaur hybrids (I remember an ankylosaurus crossed with a triceratops he called an ankylotops).  \n\nBut his main thing is different variations on giant monsters.  He LOVED Pacific Rim and Godzilla.  He likes to do different versions of Godzilla where he combines him with his favorite super heroes.  He's done all the Guardians of the Galaxy, all the MCU Avengers, every X-Man.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do with all these drawings.\n\nEdit:\n\nHad some requests to see some stuff...  Here are just few things I happen to have on my phone from pictures I took to send to family members...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JQLLY\n\nFirst I figured I'd put on the artist himself.  Chillin in his Teen Titans Go! shirt.\n\nNext is a spread I made after finding a stack of these on my kitchen counter.  Top row is Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.  \n\nSecond row is an Orca Godzilla, some kind of skunk monster (?), Pterodactyl, then an Incredible Hulk Godzilla.\n\nThird Row: Honestly not sure.  The second one I know is a Girl Godzilla we had to convince him to draw.  He's seven so anything girlish is a big no-go.\n\nFourth Row:  Iron Man Godzilla, then the rest I'm not sure.\n\nNext pic down is a picture he drew of Gollum that I loved...\n\nThen we get into the Guardians of the Galaxy.  First is Drax Godzilla, Groot Godzilla, Rocket Godzilla.  Then below it's Ego, Yondu and Star Lord. ",

You are one of the many reasons I am glad to be alive at this time in history.  Because you create new worlds and characters that reflect reality in such a powerful, but understated way. Because you have followed your heart to write and direct, this world is a better and more interesting place to live in. \n\nI was 16 when I went to see my first R-Rated movie. It was midnight, the opening night of Pan's Labyrinth and knew nothing about the movie. When I got there, the theater was close to empty, which I thought was odd.\n\nBut when the movie began, I was entranced.  I didn't expect this movie to combine history and fantasy in such a sublime way. I didn't know it would be so violent and terrifying. I didn't expect Ophelia's innocence and vulnerability to bring me to tears and make me wish I could reach in and rescue her. \n\nSeeing this movie full of violence, kindness, and bravery changed me as a person. I decided that people who refused or didn't like to watch subtitles, were stupid and didn't know what amazing art they were missing out on. I have felt empowered to write, even if I can't seem to do it well. Seeing that movie on my own was basically the first \"grown-up\" thing I had ever done. And it's a precious memory. Pan's Labyrinth will always have a special place in my heart.  \n\nIt is not the only film that I love, however. The Devil's Backbone is another personal favorite and masterpiece.  Pretty anything you have written, as well as directed, blows my mind.\n\nYou never go overboard. Everything is tastefully understated, but powerful. \n\nMy only hope is that you continue to follow your unique aesthetic, your muse in creating more and more art. Whether they are movies, books, illustrations, virtual reality, open world games,  or poetry....  Please keep creating more and more. \n\nI am a huge fan of Pablo Neruda and Federico Garcia Lorco, by the way, so I am really hoping you also publish poetry one day. Because knowing what a beautiful mind and heart you have through your work makes me certain that you also write poetry. ☺️ \n\nI try not to see trailers or read synopses for your movies anymore. Because I love the surprise and experience of finding out on my own. I have only seen posters for The Shape of Water. I wonder what it will be like when I finally get to see it. Is it a moral tale? Will there be great love and suffering? Will there be tenderness and faith? All these questions just from a poster.... It's driving me crazy. \n\nI can't wait to find out! \n",

Stephen Graham is a masterclass in making people think he talks with a heavy Italian accent from Jersey or New York, but the guy is as British as it gets. You'd have to watch him in early Guy Ritchie stuff to know \"hey, that's Al Capone from Boardwalk Empire\" or \"hey, that's Tony Pro from the Irishman\". Heck, he took a step back toward his roots as Atticus in \"Taboo\" (with Tom Hardy, who also has his share of accent work).  \n\n\nAnother one to give credit to is Benedict Wong. Guy spoke heavy as anything playing Kubkai Khan in Marco Polo and as Wong in the Marvelverse (Doctor Strange/Avengers Infinity War and Endgame), but he's also very British.",

As an Asian American, I was pretty much conditioned that any time an Asian character was in a film, especially in a highschool or college setting, said character would either be a super nerd, or a fresh off the boat immigrant with an accent that would attract mockery and ridicule. But in American Pie, when John Cho’s character ended up being a drugged out pothead, I was oddly proud, as that character far more resembled my fellow Asian American friends, more so than the nerd trope. So even though it was a small role where he played a dumb character, the fact that it didn’t hang on mocking Asian Americans, I was extremely happy and proud.",

We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. \n\nTwo years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/kgnSLWt",

Waited for quite sometime before my party was in the door.  One of the highlights of my night was seeing you drive up in your Humvee and walk in.  \n\nWe still waited for a while until we were seated.  My party was split because of the crowd, but I got seated upstairs next to Carl Lewis and you were two tables away.  I was in awe (and maybe a bit drunk) but want to thank you for at least stopping by and signing a place mat for me.  Unfortunately it ended up accidentaly getting tossed that night by the staff, but it was a cool way to celebrate my 21st.  \n\nThat autograph got me to start collecting a few other autographs and movie props so thank you for that and a fun memory.",

The director had an idea of Taxi Driver inspired Joker and he was held back by previous movies or future movies or franchises.\n\nI think this movie was an accident and was pitched at the right time for DC to try something else since everything failed before and it was a why not type of deal, but hopefully there are people smart enough to know that this could be their ticket to future success.",

I worked on the film \"Death to Smoochy\" as a lowly PA, and I had never before and have never since seen someone on set like Robin Williams.  He never turned off.  After DeVito yelled \"cut\" Robin Williams would still go with his manic improv.  It was a lot of fun being on that set on days when Robin Williams was shooting.  He had a non-stop engine/drive to entertain.  Really fun stuff.\n\nWe were filming in Times Square the day of Super Bowl XXXV (when the Ravens killed my G-men), and after we wrapped for the day, the production had rented a floor of ESPN Sportszone, and the whole cast & crew went over there to watch the game.  \n\nOf course, the crew had started a pool for the game, and everyone bought a box or two - actors included.  DeVito won the first quarter.  Edward Norton had the halftime box.  And (if I remember correctly) Robin Williams won both the 3rd quarter and final score (I think the score had the same last digits at end of 3rd and end of game, right?).\n\nOf course, we lowly crew shrugged our shoulders when the multi-millionaire actors won every.single.box.  \n\nBut to Robin Williams credit, he took the money from that and then some and bought the crew gifts at wrap.  It wasn't much.....just a stupid \"Death to Smoochy\" hat, but it was a nice gesture.  I've heard stories of actors buying the entire crew gifts before, but - other than this example - I had never seen it once in the 5 years I spent working in film production.\n\nAnyway, I felt like sharing this somewhere, so I thought I'd leave it here. I will forever remember Robin Williams energy both when the cameras were rolling but especially when they weren't, and I will always remember his generosity to the crew.\n\n\nSide story - a couple years later I was working on another film, and we were shooting in Central Park.  Who rides by on his racing bike in full biker gear - hat, racing glasses, skin tight pants, etc. - than Robin Williams.  He hops off the bike and says hello to some of the cast members and the director, and he was still the same exact guy he was a few years earlier.  Just so funny to see him in spandex and tinted sunglasses running around a set doing his improv.  ",

He then looked over to me and asked:\n\n\"So. What's good?\"\n\nI was pretty certain who the man in the hoodie was right off the bat. Being a Torontonian, I used every ounce of my resolve to be cool, and asked him what kind of game he was looking for.\n\nHe smiled and said \"I'm trying to find something my son and I can play. Maybe something we can play together since I'm not home often.\"\n\nI nodded and reached for a copy of Warcraft.  \n\n\"I think he might enjoy this, Mr. Williams.\" \n\nFor a man who I knew to be frenetic, his quiet acknowledgement and soft smile was extremely disarming. \n\nAnd so that's my memory of him. Not a comedy genius. Not as a frantic addict. Not as Mork or any of the myriad of other roles he played.\n\nMy memory of him is one of a father hoping to connect with son.\n\nRest well, Mr. Williams.\n\nI look forward to fighting alongside you in Skeleton Hell.\n \nEd: a keen eyed redditor corrected me. It was Warcraft and not Starcraft. Also: thanks for the gold!\n",

There's an unfortunate social stigma that you're wrong or should feel ashamed for having mental health issues, but please dont be too scared to seek help if you are having problems. http://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/",

Being sophomore college students, we could only afford nosebleed seats for his show here in Minnesota at the historic Northrup Auditorium on campus.  As Robin is/was one of my favorite comedians and actors, we arrived early and sat in our seats primed with excitement for the show. While we were sitting alone up on the second tier balcony (as we were an hour-plus early), a woman came up and asked us if we were big Robin William fans. \"Of course!\" we both replied, listing off all our favorite shows (Aladdin, Hook, etc.) he was in and apart of when we were kids.  Turns our Robin bought a couple tickets in the front row for loyal fans who could only afford nosebleeds. It was probably the most amazing thing that has ever happened in my life.  Rest in peace, Robin. \n\n[Photo I took of my view that night prior to his performance](http://i.imgur.com/1jEuEwZ.jpg)",

Then they realized in reviewing the scenes they would have to reshoot because Chewie wasn't moving like Chewie anymore. All from an article about the size of his feet that the director saw. One of the most underrated performances in movie history. RIP Peter",

So I spotted some obscure exit doors that would afford me a shortcut. \n\nWhen I opened the doors I found myself in a small loading area. Mr. Mayhew was sitting there alone in a wheelchair having a smoke. \n\n“How ya doing?’” I said. “Great!” he replied, with the biggest grin on his face. \n\nWe nodded at each other. I went back inside and that was that. \n\nRIP, PM.",

As for Peter thank you for everything you've done, you were an inspiration.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say thank you for your responses everyone!

Had no money for anything, but it was my first con so I was still giddy with everything going on. I see Peter Mayhew at his booth and Billy Dee Williams at his own not too far. I nerd out completely and I couldn't believe they were right there. \n\nBilly was so busy with everyone trying to line up to talk to him, Peter's line had died down a bit. I get in line, feeling bad that I can't pay him for any photograph or signature or anything. Its my turn to talk to him, and I go up to him and tell him that I've loved Chewbacca since I was a kid, and that I wanna tell him that I'm such a fan of his work. Dude is so warm and friendly, and tells me that he's glad the role has provided so much happiness to so many people. We even talk for a minute about TFA which was coming out soon, I'll never forget how he tells me, \"Oh I really think you'll be pleased, the story is quite...interesting.\" Which we all know now what he was talking about. Meanwhile I can't believe that freaking Chewbacca just teased the new movie for me. I didnt wanna hold up the line, so I just thanked him so much for his time and left really happy that I got to talked to him. RIP Peter, I'll be telling every one about this.",

I was holding the door for my friend when, to my bewilderment, Peter Mayhew and his wife come through. So there the four of us are, just kind of hanging out smoking, Peter Mayhew complementing us on our kits. I was just kinda dumbfounded. After a bit, security comes out and starts telling me and my buddy we have to go inside. Peter goes “no no, this here’s my Mandalorian guard!” Security was having none of it though. He looks at us and laughs, “sorry boys, I tried, have a good time”. I think I thanked him, I may have just mumbled incoherently. I got to meet him again a couple years later, and he was always so kind and thoughtful. He was my favorite, and losing him sucks really bad. But I’m glad he can rest now, he deserves it.
